One of the quandaries is how to deal with the enclosing structure which xml needs.

Method: hooks
 * foo
 ** bar
 - this
 -- stuff
 -- nonsense
 - that
 ** baz
 * next

 [section 1 foo]
 [inside section 1]
 [outside section 2]
 [section 2 bar]
 [inside section 2]
 [outside bullet 1]
 [bullet 1 this]
 [inside bullet 1]
 [outside bullet 2]
 [bullet 2 stuff]
 [bullet 2 nonsense]
 [close outside bullet 2]
 [close inside bullet 1
 [bullet 1 that]
 [close outside bullet 1]
 [close inside section 2]
 [section 2 baz]
 [close outside section 2]
-etc.

Method: stack
Push current type of section on a stack
if it's not already on TOS.  Pop it off and
call it's closer when it's no longer current.

* OrgLinks

** Goals:

- Find all org links in org files
       - possibly in scripts as well??
	- maybe just scripts linked to by orgmode files!!
- Store them conveniently in a repository link index orgfile
- Check all org links for validity
	- convert absolute links to relative links
	- optimize relative links
- Have =git mv= update any links to the moved file

** Scripts

- [[file:../bin/index-org-links][index-org-links]] :: latest
	- dependent on =rg= aka =ripgrep=
- [[file:../bin/org-links.bash][org-links.bash]] :: obsolete??

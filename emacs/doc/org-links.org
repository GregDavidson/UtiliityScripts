* OrgLinks

** Goals:

- Find all org links in org files
       - possibly in scripts as well??
	- maybe just scripts linked to by orgmode files!!
- Store them conveniently in a repository link index orgfile
- Check all org links for validity
	- convert absolute links to relative links
	- optimize relative links
- Have =git mv= update any links to the moved file

** Scripts

- [[file:../bin/index-org-links][index-org-links]] :: latest
	- dependent on =rg= aka =ripgrep=
- [[file:../bin/org-links.bash][org-links.bash]] :: obsolete??

** Criticism 

*** Wednesday, 25 May 2022

We need to make sure we're correctly handling all links, e.g. links to sections
within documents. Review OrgMode link syntax!

Separate finding vs. processing files
- Finding files
      - Use rg for this as currently
- Processing files
      - with a shell function or separate script
      - converting .org files to index paragraphs(s)
      - use =sed= for link extraction
      - extract =TITLE= or first top-level header

Consider overwriting requiring confirmation
- With --create-or-clobber flag
- By explicitly ending path with the index file
- Once most prospective directories are indexed
      - call with --clobber flag
      - missing index file should require confirmation!

** Original Concept for Indexing Org-Mode Files

Every .org mode file under this account should be linked to by the nearest
- INDEX.org file -- first choice
- README.org file -- second choice

By nearest, we mean
- in the same directory, or if none
- in the nearest ancestor directory

A tool, e.g. a shell script, should be available to
- report all broken links
- attach all disconnected files

*** Possibly Obsolete Ideas

An earlier version of this idea said:

All file links should begin with either
   file:greg/
or
  file:greg.*/
i.e. greg.a, etc.

- Were these supposed to be leveraging symlinks?
- Or did I just forget the =~= in front of =greg=?
